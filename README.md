## 🚀 About 
This Admin Panel includes one Dashboard, Three Pages, Four Apps, and Seven fully functional charts! ⭐

+ In today’s world, every online program interface (mainly e-commerce platforms) contains a page where information and data about customers, clients, and consumers is shown or monitored. 
+ This information/data could be based on purchases, financial transactions, or consumer service statistics. 
+ An Admin Dashboard is a visual representation of your whole data set. While it can be used in various ways, its primary function is to allow quick access to information, such as APIs. 
+ An Admin Dashboard is often shown on its own website and receives data from a linked database.

> So, today, we’ll develop a responsive and interactive Admin Dashboard using the well-known React JavaScript framework, plus the Material UI and Rechart libraries .
